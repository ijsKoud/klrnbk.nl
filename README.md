## Information

This is the next generation portfolio built with Nextjs, shadcn-ui and Tailwind. Equipped with a modern design, dark-mode support and everything a website about myself should need.

## Install

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and enable corepack using `corepack enable`

Want to create your own version of this website? Make sure to [fork it](https://github.com/ijskoud/klrnbk.nl/fork) first and edit all the contents in [constants](/apps/web/src/constants.tsx).

After that run `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies, `pnpm run dev` to spin-up the dev version and `pnpm build` to build the application.

You can use `pnpm -run start` to start the application or ship it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=ijskoud&utm_campaign=oss). Make sure to check the [.env.example](/apps/web/.env.example) file for the required environment variables.
